**Project**

On this template page users can view media from other users, add photos, edit their profile, and like posts.
Many screen sizes are considered so the site is functional and appealing for all.

**Tech and techniques**

HTML and CSS were used to make an adaptive and responsive layout.
Locally stored fonts were used. (In the 'Vendor' directory.)
The following are some features used in the project:

- Flat BEM structure
- Flexbox
- Grid
- Media Queries
- etc.

**Images**

None for now. :(

**Final thoughts?**

Well organized project.

Recommendations/Notes:

1. Organize Css files into BEM structure after the whole page is complete for one screen size.
2. Have media query sizes in order, from largest to smallest, so values dont overlap.
3. Media queries are organized according to the classes with similar css files.
