# Project 3: Around The U.S.

### Overview

- Intro
- Images
- Figma
- Github

**Intro**

This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes.
HTML and CSS were used to make an adaptive and responsive layout.

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma — we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.
